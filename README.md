## Why

- Give `Elixir` a goin-over by writing tests
- Start over with TDD. `Elixir` is a good fit with TDD as a result of having a clean syntax and built-in unit test framework (`ExUnit`)
- Explore `Erlang/OTP` features from beggining to advanced
- Be confident that you'll be able to understand concurrent and functional programming styles
- Write well-tested, robust systems in `Elixir`

## Background

I'm an Elixir and Functional Programming enthusiast and also work the language for a little. I always wanted to contribute in an active way to the Elixir's community as I'm into educational content.

This project is a direct result of my inspiration I got from a project with matching name called [Learn Go with Tests](https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests).

## Who this is for

- People who have interest to try `Elixir`
- People who are interest in picking functional programming
- People who already some `Elixir`, but want to take a next step on testing with TDD

## What you'll need

- Some device to run exercises (commonly a computer)
- Basic terminal knowledge

Note that as this project is also build with [LiveBook](https://github.com/livebook-dev/livebook) you can safely go on only with access to a web browser ðŸ˜Š
